Shortlist of concepts and terms that need good and consistent translation of
Plone in each language.

Language Specific Terms (Template document)
This file should serve as a template for creating the language-specific Plone
translation guidelines for your language. It's not a lexicon, just a hint for you.

It is obvious that coordinated translation effort improves the quality of the
translations, helping users to better recognize the interface.
Please communicate inside your translation teams and send us your term
decisions so we can publish them.

The template follows:

2) Unwelcome terms

The following is the list of words in the target language that should not appear
in the translation. May be used as a notepad while translating, storing the
stubs of words that should be searched and replaced at the end of work:

...            -> ...


3) Misc. language specific rules

Any translation notes you want to leave for future translators.
