Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.filepreviewbehavior contains a behavior for using
        Products.ARFilePreview with dexterity content types. The views and some adapters
        are overwritten ARFilePreview uses some Archetypes specific stuff.
        
        BE WARNED: If you have a dexterity setup, you may not want to install
        Archetypes. But Products.ARFilePreview was developed for Archetypes and may
        still depend on it.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Add the behavior ``collective.filepreviewbehavior.interfaces.IPreviewable`` to
        the behaviors list of your dexterity conten type, then the uploaded file will be
        converted to a HTML preview.
        
        Use as name for the file-field "file" and mark it as primary field. The file
        field should be in your primary schema interfaces, a behavior schema interface
        may not work.
        
        For more information about marking as primary field check out the dexterity
        documentation (the chapter on webdav):
        http://plone.org/products/dexterity/documentation/manual/developer-manual/advanced/webdav-and-other-file-representations
        
        
        The Views
        ---------
        
        Products.ARFilePreview provides three views:
        * *file_preview* : A view containg the download link and a the preview of the
        document embedded in the plone theme.
        * *preview_provider* : A view only containing the preview of the document. This
        view can be used as fullscreen / popup preview.
        * *file_asdoc* : A view only containing the preview of the document, but embedded
        in the plone theme.
        
        You may the make some actions for your content, collective.filepreviewbehavior
        will not create any actions.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        1.0a1
        -----
        
        * We should not expect the objects to provide the IBasic behavior, but we know
        that there is always a Title() and a Description() method (inherited from CMFCore)
        [26.11.2009, jbaumann]
        
        * MissingBinary should not fail, but skip creating the preview and put a error
        message into the log.
        [06.11.2009, jbaumann]
        
        * It should not fail if there is no primary field value
        [06.11.2009, jbaumann]
        
        * Added some tests, they are not working well because we test with a plain
        type (without any schemata and without a required file field).
        [23.10.2009, jbaumann]
        
        * Added some documentation
        [23.10.2009, jbaumann]
        
        * Initial implementation
        [22.10.2009, jbaumann]
