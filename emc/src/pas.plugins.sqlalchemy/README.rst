=====================
SQLAlchemy PAS plugin
=====================

This package provides a Zope 2 PAS plugin implementation (Pluggable Authentication Service) based on the SQLAlchemy database abstraction layer.

It allows you to store and query users and groups using a SQL database.

This package replaces the `SQLPASPlugin <http://plone.org/products/sqlpasplugin>`_. product.
It is technically a fork of that codebase.
Some tests have been rewritten but most are preserved.

Although not currently provided in a stable release, it's used in production (tested against the `pysqlite` and PostgreSQL databases only).

Setup
-----

To configure the plugin with a database, use ``z3c.saconfig``.
Define a named scoped session ``pas.plugins.sqlalchemy`` in your ``configure.zcml`` or in the ``zcml-additional`` parameter of the ``plone.recipe.zope2instance`` recipe in your buildout.

Example::

  <configure xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/db">
    <include package="z3c.saconfig" file="meta.zcml"/>

    <engine name="pas" url="postgresql://localhost/pas" />
    <session name="pas.plugins.sqlalchemy" engine="pas" />

  </configure>

Install the plugin using the included GenericSetup-profile.
Note that tables will be created automatically on installation.

You can reinstall anytime to create non-existing tables.
Note that tables are preserved on uninstallation.

Configuration from Plone
-------------------------

As an alternative to specifying the database connection information in zcml, you can use `collective.saconnect <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.saconnect>`_ to make your connections configurable on the plone control panel.

Install the package by adding it to your buildout, then install the add-on it in your plone site through Plone's control panel.
You now have a new control panel that allows you to create and edit database connections.

To add connections with generic setup add a file ``saconnections.xml`` to the generic setup profile of your site setup package, with the
following content::

  <?xml version="1.0"?>
  <connections>
       <connection
            name="pas.plugins.sqlalchemy"
            string="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@localhost/DATABASE"
       />
  </connections>

More information is available in the package description.


Custom principal, user and group model
--------------------------------------

You can register your own SQLAlchemy-based model class for all three categories.

The required class interfaces (required methods and attributes) are described in the ``interfaces`` module.
Note that you can simply subclass from the default models which implement the required interfaces.

The settings are accessible in the ZMI. You can also use a custom setup handler.

Example::

    def setup_pas_plugin(self):
        pas = self.acl_users
        plugin = pas['sql']

        plugin.manage_changeProperties(
           user_model="my_package.model.User",
           principal_model="my_package.model.Principal",
           group_model="my_package.model.Group"
           )

You may need to make sure the plugins are prioritized higher than the default ones (typically ZODB-based).


Wishlist
--------

These items are on the to-do list:

- Post-only security.
- Review of implemented interfaces - is the implementation complete?
- Handle groups title, description and email, to match newer versions of Plone.
- Tests for configuration of external model.
