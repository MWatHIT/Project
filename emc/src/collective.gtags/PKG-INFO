Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.gtags provides Google Code style tagging for Plone. There is a
        control panel that lets administrators define a vocabulary of tags, where tags
        may have a "category" prefix. For example, "Department-IT" and "Department-HR"
        would both be tags in the "Department" category. A tag "Important" has no
        category.
        
        The administrator may further decide whether users should be allowed to pick
        non-standard tags globally (if also enabled on a per-type basis), and list
        categories as required and/or unique.
        
        zope.schema field
        -----------------
        
        This is implemented via a custom zope.schema style field:
        `collective.gtags.field.Tags`. This is a sub-class of zope.schema.Set, with
        custom validation. It will only work once the package is installed, since it
        depends on the ITagSettings utility installed with this package to properly
        function.
        
        The field is accompanied by a default z3c.form widget, which uses jQuery and
        the jQuery autocomplete widget to provide the user interface.
        
        See `tagging.txt` in the package for a detailed doctest of the basic tags
        functionality.
        
        Behavior
        --------
        
        To use this field, you can either use the `Tags` field directly in your own
        schema, or use the `collective.gtags.behaviors.ITags` behavior in a Dexterity
        type or other type that supports `plone.behavior`. This behavior will place
        a tags field in the "Categorization" field set and store tags in the Subject
        Dublin Core metadata field, thus taking the place of the standard 'keywords'
        field.
